        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <h2>A Little of our history</h2>
        <p class="historry">Youthful Academy was established in 2001 by the visionary Professor Abee Tusk and his friends. He had thought in foreign schools
            and universities for 20 years before he decided to contribute to his country by forming a new school and incorporating ideas
            from his experience into the system. The school started with just primary school grades but later added middle school and 
            secondary school grades in 2005 and 2008, respectively. The school has been functioning continuously since its establishment.
        </p>
        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p class="mission">Our mission is to ensure that our students are equipped with the intellectual, social and ethical qualities
            that are required to contribute positively to our country at this time. We do this by providing the best environment
            to motivate and nurture the growth of these traits so that students excel in them.
        </p>
        <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
        <p class="vision">We aspire to be an institution where parents feel safe about the future of their children which they put in our hands
            and we are partly responsible for.</p>
